title: Still running OctoPi 0.12? You need to do some manual upgrades
date: 2017-11-01 15:45:00 +0100
excerpt: If you are still running OctoPi 0.12, due to some changes
  recently done in the python infrastructure you'll need to run
  some manual commands or you will no longer be able to upgrade.

**If you are running OctoPi 0.13 or later you can now stop reading, this only concerns OctoPi 0.12 or older :)**

It has come to my attention that there was 
[a change on python's package index PyPI on October 26th](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/distutils-sig/2017-October/031712.html)
that causes a problem with the `pip` and `setuptools` versions still installed on OctoPi versions 0.12 and
older. This problem manifest such that it is no longer possible to fetch dependencies e.g. during updates,
causing a broken install if it happens during an OctoPrint install. An example output of this kind of problem follows:

```
Scanning index of all packages (this may take a while)
Reading http://pypi.python.org/simple
Couldn't find index page for 'futures' (maybe misspelled?)
No local packages or download links found for futures>=3.1.1,<3.2
error: Could not find suitable distribution for Requirement.parse('futures>=3.1.1,<3.2')
```

The key here is the line `Reading http://pypi.python.org/simple` - `http://...` is no longer
supported since the above mentioned upgrade on PyPI's side, its replacement is the http**s** version of the URL
`https://pypi.python.org/simple`. The by now rather old tools on OctoPi 0.12 still use the old URL however and
there lies the problem. 

**To fix this**, you'll need to run two manual commands via SSH on your OctoPi instance:

  1. ``~/oprint/bin/pip install --index-url https://pypi.python.org/simple --upgrade pip``
  2. ``printf -- "[easy_install]\nindex-url = https://pypi.python.org/simple\n" > ~/.pydistutils.cfg``

These two lines will upgrade your installed version of ``pip`` to a current one that is compatible to the changes
mentioned above and also configure your Python environment's setuptools to use the new https URL so it will be able 
to fetch dependencies when updating OctoPrint.

**If you already ran into issues on update**, e.g. to 1.3.5 that was released a couple of days prior to the
PyPI change, after running the two commands up there also do this:

```
cd ~/OctoPrint
git pull
~/oprint/bin/python setup.py install
sudo service octoprint restart
```
